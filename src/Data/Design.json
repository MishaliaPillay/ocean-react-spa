These blog pages are articles about sea life and how to conserve it. After that is the About Us section which is plain text and not in a bordered box. There is a section called “This is why we care” where pollution statistics are shown, this section has a border. ",

        "description2": " An example of where this was considered is in the navbar. When the screen has a larger width the “Exploration” button is present, this button acts as a drop down menu for the “cards”, as spoken about above. When the screen size is smaller a drop-down menu makes interaction much more difficult as the text size would need to be smaller to account for the opening of a drop-down menu and a user is still able to access this through the home page “cards”. ",

The user can navigate back to the pages and learn about a different animal then answer the corresponding questions. To account for this type of user, the quiz not only gives an indication of correct and incorrect attempts but also gives explanations. There is a results page after the quiz that shows the user which questions they correctly/incorrectly answered. ",
