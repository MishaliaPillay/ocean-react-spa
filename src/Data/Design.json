This meant that it needed a different design, I decided to replace the layout which had all the blogs one after the other and replace them with cards similar to the home page. These cards had a heading for which section they direct the user to and a short description. When the user clicks on a card it alters the page to show them the specific “blog” that they have requested. To help the user know where to proceed there is a back button and a next button that the user is able to navigate through the blog list in the design section. This makes the information in the design section easier to digest as the user is presented with smaller chunks of information. ",
