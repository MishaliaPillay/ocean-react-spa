After that is the About Us section which is text not in a bordered box and there is a section called “This is why we care” where pollution statistics are shown. This section has a border. This website aims to educate sections that are text that aims to educate or inform have a border. Thus, the Theory pages, quiz and design section have borders around the information. ",

Through my research, I found that only necessary information needs to be presented on mobile devices and this means cutting down on content and focusing on how the design needs to change to account for the smaller screen size.",
        "description2": " An example of where this was considered is in the navbar. When the screen has a larger width the “Exploration” button is present, this button acts as a drop down menu for the “cards”, as spoken about above. When the screen size is smaller a drop-down menu makes interaction much more difficult as the text size would need to be smaller to account for the opening of a drop-down menu and a user is still able to access this through the home page “cards”. ",
        "description3": "Another example of mobile-first design is removing the intro paragraph on the video. This is removed on smaller devices as the video width changes and by removing it completely it reduces scroll time from if it were moved to below the video. ",
