          5 Ways (& Quick Tips) To Conserve The Ocean
        </h1>
        <p className="introParagraph">
          The ocean gives us life, and all living things depend on it. Covering
          approximately 71% of the Earth and containing 96.5% of its water, this
          water body supports an incredible diversity of life and affects
          everything from food supply to weather patterns. So, how can we
          conserve the ocean? This is an essential question since we hear that
          the ocean is in deep trouble from various effects of human activities
          like the burning of fossil fuels and overfishing.

            <h2 className="littleHeading">Eat Sustainable Seafood</h2>
            <p className="blurb">
              Three-quarters of global fisheries are either exploited or
              recovering from overfishing. According to research, seafood is
              high in protein, heart-healthy, and low in fat. Moreover, it’s one
              of the leading sources of omega-3 fatty acids, which play a huge
              role in brain development. Because of seafood’s health benefits,
              some of the most popular fish types face extinction risk.
            </p>
            <h3 className="littleHeading">
              Tip 1: Choose seafood that’s sustainable
            </h3>
            <p className="blurb">
              Look for information on where and how the fish was caught. Many
              sustainable seafood products have certifications or labels from
              reputable organizations that indicate responsible fishing
              practices.
            </p>
            <p className="blurb">
              Ask Questions: When shopping or dining out, don’t hesitate to ask
              vendors or restaurants about the origin of their seafood and the
              methods used to catch it.
            </p>
            <p className="blurb">
              Prefer Local and Seasonal: Choosing seafood that is local and in
              season can often be a more sustainable option, as it usually
              requires less transportation and supports local communities.
            </p>
            <p className="blurb">
              Avoid Overfished Species: Stay informed about which species are
              currently overfished or threatened, and avoid purchasing those to
              help reduce demand.

            <p className="blurb">
              To travel the ocean as a responsible tourist means to respect
              marine life and habitats throughout your journey. For example,
              give nesting sea turtles on the beach the freedom they need to
              lead happy lives.
            </p>
            <h3 className="littleHeading">
              Tip 2: Choose the right travel providers
            </h3>
            <p className="blurb">
              When planning your travels, choose eco-conscious companies that
              prioritize ocean conservation. These companies adhere to
              sustainable practices such as empowering communities, protecting
              marine wildlife, and utilizing educated travel guides.

            <p className="blurb">
              In the last few years, the burning of fossil fuels has been
              creating too much heat, which is responsible for global warming.
              The ocean has absorbed over 90% of the excess heat produced to
              protect the Earth and every living thing.

            <p className="blurb">
              To effectively reduce your carbon footprint, small but consistent

              Minimise the Impact of Single-Use Plastics

            <p className="blurb">
              One of the simplest ways to conserve this carbon sink is to
              eliminate, reduce, and reuse plastic products.
            </p>
            <h3 className="littleHeading">Tip 4: Reduce, reuse, recycle</h3>
            <p className="blurb">
              Before throwing anything away, think of how it can be reused. Set
              up a dedicated recycling area in your home to sort paper,
              plastics, and metals, making it easier to recycle correctly and
              consistently.

              Another way to travel responsibly is to avoid buying items made
              from marine life. They are linked to the destruction of the
              ocean’s ecosystem.

            <p className="blurb">
              However, you can combat this by ensuring the fish you eat is
              sustainably sourced. For example, sustainable fisheries do the
              following:
              <ul className="littleBlurbs">
                <li>Target plentiful fish species</li>
                <li>

                <li>
                  Discuss ocean-related issues with your local shopkeeper.
                  Always be ready to answer the key question: how can we
                  conserve the ocean? Once they understand what is at stake,
                  please encourage them to stock ocean-friendly food items.

                <li>
                  Talk with your friends, neighbors, loved ones, and lawmakers.
                  You can use social media, blogs, or any other digital media to
                  raise awareness as much as you can. Remember to speak or write
                  persuasively and present up-to-date information to stand out.

                <li>
                  Vote for public officials who support marine conservation
                  projects. Before doing that, research their ocean policies and

              The fate of the ocean is in our hands now, and we are up to the
              task. We don’t each have to do a massive change to have an impact.
              Instead, we can do simple things that reduce our carbon footprint
              and protect marine life, like eating sustainable seafood and
              eliminating single-use plastics. We can also vote for public
              officials committed to protecting marine conservation projects.
