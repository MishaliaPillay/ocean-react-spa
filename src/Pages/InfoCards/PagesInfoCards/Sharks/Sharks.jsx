          <p className="blurbParagraph">
            The biggest sharks in the ocean include the whale shark, megamouth
            shark, and basking shark. You might be surprised to learn that the
            three largest sharks in the worldâ€™s oceans are all filter feeders
            despite their size. These massive creatures pose no threat to humans
            and subsist on incredibly small zooplankton while cruising passively
            around the ocean. Other large species of shark, like the thresher
            shark and Greenland shark, have other interesting attributes, like a
            whip-like tail and extreme longevity, that make them notable in
            addition to their size. On this list, we rank the biggest sharks in
            the world based on a combination of their length and weight.
