        <h1>Critical Analysis Essay on Net/Web Art</h1> <h2>Introduction</h2>{" "}
        <p>
          This essay is a critical examination of the Net Art, “it’s doing It”.
          This is an artwork that was created by nine artists who wrote computer
          programs that took instructions as parameters, and this resulted in
          computer-generated art. This analysis will be carried out through the
          usage of the framework by Marshall McLuhan, “The medium is the
          message”, with a focus on the effects of choosing the Internet as the
          medium for this work. An evaluation through the lens of Intermedial
          studies will serve as a framework to unpack the content of the work
          itself. The analysis will help determine if “It’s doing It”, is a
          relevant and effective example of Net Art that can inspire and inform
          the designers of today.{" "}

        <h2>What is Net Art?</h2>
        <p>
          For one to understand Net Art one needs to break the bounds of what
          media forms art can be created in (Ricci, 2020). Conventionally art is
          in the form of a painting or a sculpture, Benedetta Ricci challenges
          readers to “envision an algorithm, software or code” as art. Net Art
          is an art that cannot exist without the Internet, it is created for,
          composed through, and displayed on the Internet.
        </p>
        <p>
          Chatel (2019) describes Net Art as “process-oriented” as artists
          explore the vastness of this new media type, thus the spectrum of
          topics and areas covered in Net Art is endless. Artists tackle the
          complex nature of “networks and computing structures”- this is
          important to note since designers create these structures with code,
          and it is through the creation of Net Art that they become “artists”
          who challenge these very systems.
        </p>
        <p>
          A “sub-genre” of Net Art is Software Art which is “visualizing the
          result from a set of algorithms and codes”. Based on the data given to
          the algorithm different results may be yielded, the visual aspect
          helps identify gaps in the data which is a useful tool that can aid in
          the prevention of misrepresentation. Software art is created when the
          concept is encoded in the system by the artists and beyond the code
          the artist has no control over the resulting artwork, thus unique and
          interesting visuals arise.
        </p>
        <h2>Explain “it’s doing It” and its relevance for designers.</h2>
        <p>
          This artwork falls part of Software art, there are a total of nine
          artists that worked on this project and each artist created a computer
          program that encoded instructions (see Figures 1-9) into the program
          and for 45 days these programs generated one image each day. This Net
          Art ran from 11 December 2015 till 24 January 2016, and every artist's
          computer program generated an image related to their instruction – the
          viewer is unable to see the code and only sees the resulting images.
          This was an interesting project since the computer programs ran the
          same code every day, yet the results differed in small and large ways
          each time. This is equivalent to a user asking ChatGPT the same
          question every day in the exact same format as they did the previous
          day, but the AI responds uniquely each time.{" "}
